# Reproducing results in paper

Install the package by typing in R: 

```r
  devtools::install_github("OlavNikolaiBreivik/winterSurvey/ICESpaperSpatioTemporal")
```

Follow the script `script/runWithOfficialData.R` to approximately reproduce results in paper. Note that Russian data is not included, so results will only be approximately the same as in the paper.  Access to the entire dataset can be granted through contracted collaboration in joint projects including the Russian Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography.
